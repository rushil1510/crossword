# Simple crossword built with React+Vite

- This project was built using [React.JS](https://react.dev/), and data is currently hardcoded onto the backend.  I plan to build a simple backend using [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) to simplify data manipulation.
- The deployment is currently done on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- Code is pretty self-explanatory and most of the work was done by [this](https://react-crossword.jaredreisinger.com/) library
- Will try to get better at front-end and writing READMEs :p
